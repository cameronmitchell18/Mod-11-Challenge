# UFO Analysis :alien: :rocket:

## Purpose of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was for Dana (a respected journalist) to be able to display her data of UFO sightings in a web page that anyone could visit. Due to the overwhelming amount of data that Dana had though, there needed to be an Excel style table built within the web page, along with, a couple of filters to allow users to filter their data based off certain criterias. 

## Walking through the Web Page: 

To begin, we have a short summary posing a question that asks "Are we alone in the Universe?" and gives a little bit of background on what questions we are trying to solve through this data and web page.

Next, we see on the far left hand of the page you can filter by certain critera based off what you are interested in seeing. For example, lets say you were interested in seeing if there have been any UFO Sightings in Bonita California. The filters in the image below allow you to search for that exact city and state.

If you filtered by the two criteria as mention above, the table will filter and give you the result below.

![Result](/static/images/bonita.png "Result")

The filters allow for all sorts of results and do not just limit you to date, state, or country. 

## Summary:

I think that this web page overall for a first time page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is alright. Some of the downsides to this webpage though is that alot of it is very dark and rather unappealing. It sort of just looks like something you could make on MS Word. Not a lot of interatction and not very visually appealing. 

Two changes i would make to this web page are;

1. I would start with one filter button that allows users to select what column they want to filter on. Undearneath that though, i would add a "Create New Filter" button that populates the same button as from above allowing them to filter the table further if they so decide to. This would help keep the page clean and uncluttered. 

2. Being that Dana is a journalist and this data was gathered from new articles, when a user filters and finds their filtered criteria, i would add a link to the full news article. I would make the "Comments" text a clickable link so if the user is interested in the whole article, they can easily get to it.
